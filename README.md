# Project 2: C-Language Introduction to MPI
The current repository presents a code that uses MPI to read a moderately large (wiki_dump.txt, 1.7GB) file containing approximately 1M Wikipedia entries, 1 entry per line. The code will look for a keyword in a list of 50,000 words (keywords.txt, extracted from a common cracking dictionary) in the wikipedia entry files. 
The files are in /625 folder. 

The task is as follow:
1- Read the Wiki files into memory
2- Check for key word matches
3- Print out an alphabetized list of words which appeared in the text strings, with their indices (by line number).

The results are shown in "Report.pdf"# P2_MPI_Intro
